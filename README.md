# hydra-synchron-svcs
A [Hydra-based](https://github.com/pnxtech/hydra) Synchronization Service.

Supporting delayed message dispatching for periodic task sequencing and job scheduling. Backed by MongoDB.

## Intended use

The Synchron service is intended for use in its docker container form and deployed to a Docker Swarm or Kubernetes cluster. Available container images are hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pnxtech/hydra-synchron-svcs).

> Recommended release on docker hub: `pnxtech/hydra-synchron-svcs:1.2.3`

#### Infrastructure requirements
Synchron is a Hydra microservice and so an accessible instance of Redis is required.  Additionally, Synchron required an accessible instance of MongoDB.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

This service exists to solve the following key distributed computing problem.

> "How does a microservice type (with many instances) perform singular periodic tasks while avoiding the duplication of work?"

Consider:
  * If you put a timer inside of a microservice so that it can execute periodic tasks - then how do you prevent multiple instances of that service from each performing the same periodic task?
  * How do you ensure that the scheduled task executes on time?

Why not just use a job service? With Hydra, the ability to create jobs/tasks queuing are present by default.  So microservices can queue messages for themselves or each other - at will.  The problem this service solves is one of the creation and management of system-wide periodic orchestration events.
